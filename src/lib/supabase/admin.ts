/**
 * Service-role client. SERVER ONLY.
 *
 * This key bypasses every Row Level Security policy in the schema, so it is
 * deliberately the single place in the codebase that touches it:
 *
 *   * the variable is NOT prefixed NEXT_PUBLIC_, so Next.js will never inline
 *     it into a browser bundle
 *   * this module imports "server-only", so importing it from a Client
 *     Component is a build error rather than a silent leak
 *   * it has two callers, and both need to act outside any one user's view:
 *     the reminder dispatcher, which reads every user's queued reminders, and
 *     adding a teammate, which creates an auth user
 *
 * Anything else that serves a user request should use `@/lib/supabase/server`,
 * which runs as the signed-in user and is governed by RLS. A caller here must
 * check the caller's own role first — there is no policy left to do it.
