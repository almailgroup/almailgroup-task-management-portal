/**
 * Keeps a task list live, for one project or for the general list.
 *
 * Status and priority edits are applied straight to local state so the board
 * reacts immediately. Anything touching the assignee set asks the server to
 * re-render instead, because a task_assignments payload carries only ids and
 * resolving them here would cost a round trip per event. Those refreshes are
 * debounced so a burst of changes collapses into one refetch.
 *
 * Realtime filters support `eq` but not `is null`, so the general list cannot
 * be filtered server-side. It subscribes to every task and discards the ones
 * belonging to a project.
