 * The themes a person can choose, and the one fact the code needs about
 * each: whether it is light or dark.
 *
 * Each theme's colours live in globals.css as a block of tokens under its own
 * class. This list is the other half — the picker's order, the labels, the
 * swatch it draws — and a unit test holds the two to each other, so a theme
 * cannot be offered without colours or coloured without being offered.
 *
 * Light and Dark are the house style: monochrome, nothing saturated. The
 * others tint the surfaces or the main action, and nothing else. Amber means
 * late or urgent work in every one of them, which is why no theme here is
 * warm enough to be confused with it.
