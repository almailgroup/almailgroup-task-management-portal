 * Gather what the assistant is allowed to know about the caller's work.
 *
 * Every read goes through the normal RLS-scoped queries, so the snapshot is
 * already the caller's own view of the board: a member sees only the tasks
 * assigned to them, a manager sees the projects they belong to. The assistant
 * needs no permission logic of its own, and nothing it says can be broader
 * than what that person could already open in the UI.
 *
 * Counts come from the same `summarise` the dashboard cards use, so the
 * assistant and the dashboard can never disagree about how many are overdue.
