/**
 * End-to-end checks against a real build.
 *
 * The signed-out pages need no backend. The signed-in ones run against
 * `tests/mock/supabase.mjs`, a small stand-in that answers like PostgREST and
 * GoTrue and keeps what it is told, so a spec can create a task and then find
 * it. It enforces nothing: row-level security is verified against a real
 * Postgres, never here, and the production project is never a test target.
 *
 * Point BASE_URL at a deployment to run the same specs against it instead.
