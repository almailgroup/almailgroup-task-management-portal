/**
 * The daily review's fifth question.
 *
 * Today asks four things about work that is not done, and one about work
 * that is: what got finished. When the page was narrowed to a bounded read
 * of open tasks, that fifth answer was left deriving from the same list —
 * which excludes every row it is about — so the line never appeared again.
 * Nothing caught it, because "no completed work today" is what a quiet day
 * looks like too.
 *
 * Asserted as presence, never as a count: the mock keeps one workspace for
 * the whole run and other specs close tasks in it.
