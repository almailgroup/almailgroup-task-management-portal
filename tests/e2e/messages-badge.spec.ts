/**
 * The unread count beside Messages in the rail.
 *
 * It is a plain number, read once by the app's layout, and nothing on the
 * client subscribes to it — unlike the notification bell, which has its own
 * realtime channel. So the only thing that can move it is the layout being
 * rendered again, and the only thing that causes that is whichever Server
 * Action changed what it counts invalidating the right path.
 *
 * `markConversationRead` invalidates `/messages` while the thread itself
 * lives at `/messages/<id>`, which looks like it should not be enough. It is:
 * an action that revalidates anything re-renders the tree it was called from.
 * Pinned here because that is a fact about the framework rather than about
 * this code, and the failure if it ever stops being true is silent — a badge
 * sitting at 3 while you read the messages it is counting.
 *
 * Desktop only: on a phone the rail is inside a drawer behind "More".
