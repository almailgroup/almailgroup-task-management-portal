 * password is never checked — these specs are about the app, and what a wrong
 * password does is covered against the real thing.
 *
 * State is shared: the mock keeps one workspace in memory for the whole run
 * and specs run in parallel, so nothing here asserts on a total. Anything a
 * spec creates carries a unique name and is found by that name.
