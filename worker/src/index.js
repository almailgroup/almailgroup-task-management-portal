/**
 * The assistant's language model, kept off the app server.

 * The portal sends the question and a snapshot of the board the asker is
 * allowed to see; this forwards both to Gemini and returns the answer. It
 * exists for one reason: the Gemini key lives here, as a Cloudflare secret,
 * and never goes near Vercel — where anything is one `NEXT_PUBLIC_` typo away
 * from the browser.
 *
 * It is server-to-server only. There is deliberately no CORS header, so a page
 * cannot call it directly even if somebody learns the address.
 *
 * Plain JavaScript, and nothing is imported, so this file is exactly what goes
 * into Cloudflare's browser editor — copy it whole. The types below are JSDoc,
 * which is a comment at runtime and still checked against the portal's own
 * definitions by `npm run typecheck`.
 *
 * @typedef {import("../../src/lib/assistant/types").AssistantMessage} AssistantMessage
 * @typedef {import("../../src/lib/assistant/types").AssistantSnapshot} AssistantSnapshot
 *
 * @typedef {object} Env
 * @property {string}  GEMINI_API_KEY  From Google AI Studio. A secret.
 * @property {string} [SHARED_SECRET]  Shared with the portal. A secret.
 * @property {string} [GEMINI_MODEL]   Plain text; model names come and go.
