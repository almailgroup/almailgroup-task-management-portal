# The assistant's model

A Cloudflare Worker that stands between the portal and Google Gemini.

It exists for one reason: **the Gemini key lives here and never goes near
Vercel.** Anything the Next.js app holds is one `NEXT_PUBLIC_` typo away from
the browser; a key on Cloudflare cannot leak that way. The portal calls this
Worker server-to-server, so the browser never learns its address either.

If the Worker is not deployed, or is down, or answers anything but `200`, the
portal falls back to its own local brain — the counting answers in
`src/lib/assistant/local-brain.ts`. The panel is never simply dead.

---

## What you need

- A Google account (for the Gemini key)
- A Cloudflare account — the free plan is enough
- Node 18+ on the machine you run these commands from

---

## 1. Get a Gemini API key

Open **[aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)** →
**Create API key**. Copy it somewhere safe; Google shows it once.

> **Read this before pointing it at the real board.** On the *free* tier Google
> uses what you send to improve its products, and human reviewers may read it.
> Your board carries client names, shipment details and staff names. Adding a
> billing account to the same key moves it to the paid tier, where prompts are
> not used for training — and at this app's volume Flash costs pennies a month.
> Free is fine for trying it out. Decide knowingly before it becomes the
> company's assistant.

## 2. Check which models your key can actually use

Model names come and go, and the free tier only ever carries some of them.
Ask your key rather than guessing:

```bash
curl -s https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models \
  -H "x-goog-api-key: YOUR_KEY" | grep '"name"'
```

No terminal? Open this in a browser tab instead — it is a plain GET:

```
https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models?key=YOUR_KEY
```

(That puts the key in your browser history. Fine for a one-off check; clear it
afterwards if it bothers you.)

Pick a **Flash** model from that list. The Worker defaults to the newest one
that was current when this was written; set the `GEMINI_MODEL` variable to
choose another.

Two things the list does not tell you. Every current model *thinks* before it
answers, and that reasoning is spent from the same token budget as the reply —
which is why `maxOutputTokens` here is 4096 rather than the few hundred an
answer needs. And a model appearing in the list is not proof it is free: the
list is what your key can see, the free tier is a separate quota. If the log
shows `429`, move down a step — `gemini-2.5-flash` has been on the free tier
the longest.

## 3. Make a shared secret

So that only the portal can spend your quota. Any 32+ random characters will
do. In a terminal:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"
```

Or, with no terminal, in any browser's developer console (F12 → Console):

```js
crypto.randomUUID() + crypto.randomUUID()
```

Keep the output. It goes in two places, and they must match.

## 4. Deploy the Worker

Two routes. **A** needs nothing installed; **B** is better if you will be
changing the Worker more than once.

### A. In the Cloudflare dashboard, no computer setup

1. **[dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com)** → **Workers & Pages**
   → **Create** → **Start with Hello World!** → **Deploy**.
   Name it `almailgroup-task-management`. First time, Cloudflare asks you to pick a
   `workers.dev` subdomain — any name; it becomes part of the address.
2. On the Worker, choose **Edit code**. Select everything in the editor and
   replace it with the whole of
   [`worker/src/index.js`](src/index.js) — it is plain JavaScript with nothing
   imported, so it pastes in as it is. **Deploy**.
3. Back on the Worker → **Settings** → **Variables and Secrets** → **Add**:

   | Type | Name | Value |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Secret | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | the key from step 1 |
   | Secret | `SHARED_SECRET` | the value from step 3 |
   | Text | `GEMINI_MODEL` | only if step 2's list had no `gemini-2.5-flash` |

   Then **Deploy** again, so the variables take effect.
4. The Worker's address is on its overview page:
   `https://almailgroup-task-management.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`. Copy it.

The cost of this route: the dashboard now holds the deployed code, and this
repository no longer matches it. Change the Worker here and you must paste it
across again. Route B keeps the two in step.

### B. From a terminal

```bash
cd worker
npm install
npx wrangler login          # opens a browser once
npx wrangler deploy         # creates the Worker and prints its address
npx wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY   # paste the key from step 1
npx wrangler secret put SHARED_SECRET    # paste the secret from step 3
```

Deploy first, then the secrets: `wrangler secret put` needs the Worker to
exist, and secrets take effect immediately without another deploy. Between the
two commands the Worker refuses every request — it has no secret to check
against, and an endpoint that spends your Gemini quota should not sit open
while you fetch the next command.

Secrets are stored encrypted on Cloudflare. Nothing you typed is written to
this repository — that is what `wrangler secret put` and the dashboard's
**Secret** type are for, rather than `[vars]` in `wrangler.toml`.

## 5. Tell the portal about it

In **Vercel → your project → Settings → Environment Variables**, for
**Production and Preview**:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ALMAIL_AI_WORKER_URL` | the address from step 4 |
| `ALMAIL_AI_WORKER_SECRET` | the secret from step 3 |

Then **redeploy** — environment variables are read at build time, so an
existing deployment will not pick them up on its own.

## 6. Check it

Open the portal, click **AI assistant** at the foot of the sidebar, and ask
*"what is overdue?"*. A real answer in prose means Gemini is answering. A
terse, counted answer means it fell back to the local brain — see below.

---

## When it does not work

The portal never shows you the reason, on purpose: whoever is asking cannot
act on it. The reason is in the Worker's log.

```bash
npx wrangler tail
```

Or, with no terminal: the Worker's page in the dashboard → **Logs** → **Begin
log stream**. Ask the assistant something while it is running.

| What you see | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `Gemini replied 400: API key not valid` | Wrong key, or not saved. Re-run `wrangler secret put GEMINI_API_KEY`. |
| `Gemini replied 404` | That model name is not available to your key. Redo step 2. |
| `Gemini replied 503` | The free-tier model was busy. Asked twice already; ask again. |
| `Gemini replied 429` | Free-tier limit hit. `PerMinute` clears itself; `PerDay` waits for midnight Pacific, or add billing. |
| `401`, and `SHARED_SECRET is not set` | You deployed but never set it. Run `wrangler secret put SHARED_SECRET`. |
| `401` from the Worker, nothing logged | `ALMAIL_AI_WORKER_SECRET` and `SHARED_SECRET` differ. |
| Nothing at all in `tail` | The portal is not calling it. `ALMAIL_AI_WORKER_URL` is unset or the deployment predates it — redeploy. |

Test the Worker without the portal:

```bash
curl -i -X POST "$ALMAIL_AI_WORKER_URL" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $ALMAIL_AI_WORKER_SECRET" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages":[{"id":"1","role":"user","text":"What is overdue?","at":"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z"}],
       "snapshot":{"viewer":{"name":"Admin","role":"admin"},"locale":"en","timeZone":"Asia/Dubai",
       "takenAt":"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z","tasks":[],"counts":{"total":0,"todo":0,"inProgress":0,
       "inReview":0,"done":0,"overdue":0,"dueToday":0,"unassigned":0,"noDueDate":0}}}'
```

`200` with `{"text":"…"}` is a working Worker.

---

## Changing things: what comes back

The Worker can propose a change as well as answer a question. When the
snapshot says `viewer.canManage`, three tools are declared to the model —
`create_task`, `set_task_status`, `reschedule_task` — and a reply may carry:

```json
{ "text": "Here is what I would create.",
  "action": { "name": "create_task", "arguments": { "title": "…", "projectId": "…" } } }
```

`action` is a **proposal and nothing more**. The Worker has no database
access of any kind: it cannot create a task, and calling a tool changes
nothing. The portal resolves the ids to names, shows the person a card, and
only on Confirm runs it — through the same Server Action the ordinary buttons
call, so row-level security, the review gate and the role checks all apply
exactly as they do to a click. Every argument is re-validated against a schema
at that point; an id that is not a uuid never reaches a query.

Without `canManage`, no tools are sent at all and `action` is always `null`.

## What it sends, and what it does not

Only the snapshot the portal already built — and that snapshot is the asker's
own view of the board, assembled through the same row-level security as the
rest of the app. A member's question carries only the tasks assigned to them.
There is no service-role access here and no permission logic of its own.

For a viewer who may change things the snapshot also carries the id and name
of each project and each teammate, because a tool call has to name them by id.
That is the same list the New Task form already shows that person.

It does not send: email addresses, passwords, attachments, comments, or
anything about anyone the asker could not already see in the UI.

The wire types are imported from `../src/lib/assistant/types.ts` rather than
copied, so the two ends cannot drift apart.

## Reading the logs

**Workers & Pages → your Worker → Observability → Logs.** The Events list shows
one line per request; click a row for the whole event. A failed call logs
`Gemini call failed: Gemini replied <status>: <what Gemini said>` — the status
and the reason are in that summary line deliberately, because logging the
Error itself put its *stack* there instead and hid the only half worth reading.

A 503 from a free-tier Flash model is ordinary, not a fault: one question
succeeding and the next failing twenty seconds later is what a busy shared
model looks like. The Worker asks a second time before giving up, so a line
reading `asking once more` followed by nothing is a retry that worked.

## Tests

```bash
cd worker && npm test
```

Node's own runner, no framework, the same file that goes into Cloudflare's
editor, and Gemini stubbed. It covers the failures that are invisible from the
portal — a reply that is all reasoning and no answer, a blocked prompt, a bad
key — plus the properties worth keeping: the API key never appears in a URL, a
Worker with no secret of its own serves nobody, a viewer who may not change
things is never offered the tools that would let them, and a busy model is
asked twice while a wrong key is not.

## Local development

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars   # then fill it in; it is gitignored
npm run dev
```

## Arabic

The portal decides which language to answer in from the question itself, not
from the interface language, and sends that as `snapshot.replyIn`. Somebody
running the portal in English who types in Arabic is speaking Arabic.

For Arabic the system prompt asks for **Kuwaiti**, not Modern Standard: the
people using this work together in an office in Kuwait, and newsreader Arabic
reads as a form letter. Task titles, project names and people's names are
never translated — the reader has to be able to find them on the board — and
numbers stay in Latin digits, as the rest of the portal writes them.

A snapshot without `replyIn` — an older portal — falls back to the interface
language, so the two can be deployed in either order.

**This lives in the Worker, so changing it means redeploying the Worker.**
Updating the portal alone changes which language is asked for, not how it is
written.
