-- everyone here already works together, and a single room that everybody can
-- see is the thing a small team actually uses. It is modelled so a `room`
-- column could be added later without moving the messages.
--
-- Deliberately separate from `comments`, which belong to a task and are part
-- of its record. A message here is conversation, and is allowed to be deleted
-- by the person who wrote it.
